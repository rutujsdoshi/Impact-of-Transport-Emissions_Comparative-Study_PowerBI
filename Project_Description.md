This project provides a comprehensive understanding of the Impact of Transportation as a sub-sector responsible for green house gas emissions and its impact on the climate.
The insights derived from the Project are based on 30-year historical data.

The Project provides a comparison between United States, India and China in terms of - 
🔹 Total carbon emissions from Transportation.
🔹 Per-Capita emissions from Transportation.
🔹 Aviation Emissions.
🔹 Railway transport impact on the climate.
🔹 Fossil Fuel Production.
🔹 Electricity generation from renewables data.
🔹 Hydro-Power generation data.
🔹 Wind-Power generation data.
🔹 Solar-Power generation data.
🔹 Future Projections of Road Transportation.

Project Learnings: 
🔎 Created interactive dashboards to track the historical data of carbon emissions spanning over 30 years.
🔎 Used various filters and slicers to accurately represent and customize the data.
🔎 Used advanced excel techniques to filter data sets which were used to clearly communicate the problem , the solution, and the future of transportation.
🔎 Used different types of data representation tools such as area charts , Stacked area charts , line charts , mapping tools , pie charts and stacked bar charts to represent the gathered data.
